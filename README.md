# PartiPlay
Play is a central aspect of childhood development, with games as a vital tool to promote it. However, neurodivergent children, especially those in neurodiverse environments, are underserved by HCI games research. Most existing work takes on a top-down approach, disregarding neurodivergent interest for the majority of the design process. Co-design is often proposed as a tool to create truly accessible and inclusive gaming experiences. Nevertheless, co-designing with neurodivergent children within neurodiverse groups brings about unique challenges, such as diferent communication styles, sensory needs and preferences. Building upon recommendations from prior work in neurodivergent, mixed-ability, and child-led co-design, we propose a concrete participatory game design kit for neurodiverse classrooms: PartiPlay

## Structure
This toolkit includes instructions for running 5 co-design sessions and worksheets that may be utilised to do so. With this toolkit researchers, teachers, educators, or other interested parties can run their own co-design sessions, changing and adapting materials when needed, and co-design their own games with neurodiverse groups of children.
