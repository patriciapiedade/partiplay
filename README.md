# PartiPlay
Play is a central aspect of childhood development, with games as a vital tool to promote it. However, neurodivergent children, especially those in neurodiverse environments, are underserved by HCI games research. Most existing work takes on a top-down approach, disregarding neurodivergent interest for the majority of the design process. Co-design is often proposed as a tool to create truly accessible and inclusive gaming experiences. Nevertheless, co-designing with neurodivergent children within neurodiverse groups brings about unique challenges, such as diferent communication styles, sensory needs and preferences. Building upon recommendations from prior work in neurodivergent, mixed-ability, and child-led co-design, we propose a concrete participatory game design kit for neurodiverse classrooms: PartiPlay

## Structure
This toolkit includes instructions for running 5 co-design sessions and worksheets that may be utilised to do so. With this toolkit researchers, teachers, educators, or other interested parties can run their own co-design sessions, changing and adapting materials when needed, and co-design their own games with neurodiverse groups of children.

## Instructions
We present these instructions in the past tense, re-telling our use of the toolkit, but not inforcing our methodology on future users.
We provided various worksheets and printable materials throughout the co-design sessions, these are available within the folder named “Worksheets”, they are referenced in this guide with their file names as “[WX]”, where X is a number. Whenever children were asked to fill out a worksheet, they were allowed to do this with written words or drawings, the space provided was designed to accommodate both. This measure was put in place to make the activities accessible to the many neurodivergent children who struggled with reading and writing, but it was utilized by many more students who preferred to express their thoughts with pictures rather than words. During presentations children who did not wish to present were allowed to stay back at their tables.

### Session 1 – Building Rapport
**Introduction** – Introducing the team, the goal of the project “building a game together that you can ALL play together” and the Ozobots.
**Icebreaker** – To build rapport and start learning the children’s names, we started with an icebreaker, using a foam ball to make the social mechanics of it explicit. The ball was passed around the class between the students, teacher, and the researchers. Whomever held the ball told the group their name, age, how they were feeling, and a fun fact about them. The ball was then passed to the next person.
**Introduction** - Then we introduced this session’s activities.
**Groups** – In each class, four groups were put together by the respective teacher, to build a sense of partnership and belonging we asked each team member to fill out a worksheet [W1]. In said worksheet, students filled out each of their names and decided on a team name, which was also filled in.
  **Activity 1: Folder Decoration** – To create a sense of continuation throughout the sessions and give the students a record of them that they can own after the project is finished, we decided that each child should have their own project portfolio. To house each portfolio, each child was given an A4 folder. And to build excitement and ownership around it, each child got to decorate their folder, creating drawings in paper that were laminated to the folder by the research team.
  **Activity 2: Robot Decoration** - To familiarize the children with the Ozobots, we engaged them in a crafting activity in which they were given a kit (Figure 1) with which to customize their robot. Each kit contained gem stickers, googly eyes, pompons, sticky tac, pipe cleaners, plasticine, blank and multicolored paper. The children were also allowed to use their colored pencils and pens, glue sticks and scissors. Each group was given a single Ozobot do collaboratively decorate. To preserve the children’s work, their robots were photographed digitally and with a polaroid camera, the latter’s pictures were given to the children along with a worksheet [W2]. In this worksheet children had space to glue their robot’s picture and name it.

**Presentations** – To wrap up the session, each group presented to the class their robot. They were asked to share the robot’s name and whatever characteristics they deemed important.
### Session 2 – Exploring the Ozobots
**Introduction –** To start off the session, children were asked to recall the events of the previous session. Seeing as many had autonomously discovered how to turn on the Ozobot, we asked them to explain to their classmates how to do it. Then we introduced this session’s activities.
  **Activity 1: Storytelling** – To familiarize the children with the Ozobot markers as a programming tool, children
were asked to tell a story about the Ozobot’s day. For this they were given an A2 cartoonish map [W3] of a town
on which they were asked to create lines with the markers that allowed the Ozobot to go about its day as they
told the story (Figure 2). An A4 version of the map and black paper were also provided as scratch paper.

Activity 2: Puzzle – To introduce the Ozobot puzzle (Figure 3) as another programming tool, children were tasked
with guiding the Ozobot home. For this a start piece was placed on one side of the table and another, inside a
house structure, on the other side. Children used the remaining puzzle pieces to unite the two, creating a path
for the Ozobot to go home.

Dance – To explore the potential of the remote-control feature of the Ozobot mobile app, children were asked
to make the Ozobot dance. Each group got to pick their own song and decorate paper scenarios [W4] to create
their ideal dancefloor. The researchers then played the chosen song, and the children used the mobile app to
make the Ozobot move to said song and change LED colors accordingly.
